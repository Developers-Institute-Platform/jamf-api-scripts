# jamf-api-scripts

Collection of scripts using the Jamf API to simplify repetitive tasks. All scripts use a series of functions inside the Resources folder. These functions perform the actual API tasks on your Jamf Pro server. You must supply a config file to each script but the config file can be created with prompts by using the -o flag.
